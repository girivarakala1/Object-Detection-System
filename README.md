# Object-Detection-System

Description:
Developed a robust object detection system leveraging the YOLOv8 model and OpenCV in Python. The system offers a user-friendly interface allowing users to choose between full-screen object detection or define multiple regions of interest (ROIs) by drawing enclosed shapes using the mouse.

Key Achievements:

Implemented YOLOv8 for accurate and efficient real-time object detection.
Designed an intuitive user interface for user interaction and flexibility.
Enabled users to draw enclosed shapes on the image for region-specific object detection.
Integrated masking and counting functionalities based on total region area or drawn lines.
